# life-reading-app


## Description:

Our team has created a application that allows the user to have their fortune and horoscope read. The user begins on our landing page where they are given some general information about the mystical arts and how to to precede with the readings.  To continue, the user must type in their sign and then they are taken to our fortune page where they are presented with an array of tarot cards.  After picking three of the random 12 cards, our application displays the user's past, present, and future fortunes. Each displayed card shows the title and meaning behind the card.  Below those fortunes, is the user's horoscope and some extra features pertaining to them based of their sign.  This application can help beginner's who are looking for a simple glance into the mystical arts.  In addition, this app also helps refocus users and give them a new outlook on any questions they may have in their life.  As a team, we learned that prepping for collaboration is huge and should also be done extensively before any code gets written. Also, having open lines of communication between teammates is very important and helped us to stay consistent and can quickly adapt to any changes or errors.
